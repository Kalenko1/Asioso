# Asioso Project

## Project Overview

The **Asioso** project is a Java-based web application developed using **Spring Boot**, **Maven**, and **Thymeleaf** for frontend integration. It exposes a **REST API** that fetches product information, which is then displayed on a dynamic web page. This project demonstrates core Java development skills, integration of RESTful services, and frontend management using JSP/Thymeleaf templates.

**Core Technologies:**
- **Java 17** (or higher)
- Spring Boot (Web and REST API)
- Maven (for dependency management)
- Thymeleaf (for frontend templating)
- GitHub (version control)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## Features

### Key Features:
- **RESTful API**: Exposes an endpoint that returns product data. The product information is fetched from the backend and served via a REST service.
- **Frontend**: Displays product listing and detailed product pages using Thymeleaf templates integrated with Spring Boot.
- **Error Handling**: Implements a global exception handler to catch and display errors in a user-friendly format.
- **Unit Testing**: Critical code components are covered by unit tests to ensure application reliability.
- **CI/CD**: Uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration to automate testing and deployment.
